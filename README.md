# form-validation

To Do:
- inputs & labels (full name, email, country, zip code, password and password confirmation)
- when you leave a field if the input is invalid you'll get a red message and the input's border will turn to red.
- when you press submit and all the fields are ok you get the message "sent succesfully" in green
